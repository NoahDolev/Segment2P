# Segment2P
Automated segmentation of micrographs containing fluorescent cell soma

## Goal 
This is a small repo which aims to help a user of segment2p to train a model on their own data. The notebook walks you through training the model. Please follow the instruction [here](Train_Model.ipynb)

## Using the model
The trained model behind the segment2p algorithm can be found [www.segment2p.co.il](http://www.segment2p.co.il) and is based on the publication:
Dolev, N., et al. "Segment2P: Parameter-free automated segmentation of cellular fluorescent signals". bioRxiv (2019)
